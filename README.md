## Introduction

Insurance fraud is a significant problem for insurance companies, leading to increased costs for both insurers and policyholders. This project aims to detect fraudulent claims using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about insurance claims, including customer details, policy information, incident details, and claim amounts. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named `insurance_claims.csv`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Fraud Detection _xtended.ipynb` in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis and build the fraud detection model.

## Results

The notebook includes various data visualizations and analysis steps to understand the dataset better. Key findings include:

- The dataset has a skewed distribution of the fraud reported label.
- The `incident_state` and `age` features are significant predictors of fraud.
- Several visualizations, such as bar charts and count plots, help to understand the relationship between different features and fraud reported.
